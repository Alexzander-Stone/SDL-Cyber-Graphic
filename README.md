# Project description: 
We were given a graphics framework (SDL) to use in C++ to render an image to
the display. Given primitives in the SDL framework and a few from Dr. Malloy,
we were expected to create an image with a variety of shapes and objects. The
image itself could be chosen freely, so creativity was valued. I chose to take
inspiration from a GIF
( https://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/coffee_in_rain_by_kirokaze-d98qb8z.gif )
and the cyberpunk genre to create a room with a terminal and colorful light,
bricks with random dithering, an outlet, and a window with star light. The
terminal itself contained many pieces, like buttons that changed colors and
terminals with static, and was the focus of the scene. Overall, I was happy
that the "animation" I created went well and the dithered lighting effect that
was produced by the lamp at the top of the scene.
